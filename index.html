                There was high priority issue has been arise after the
                production deployment of the application and it contained
                25,000+ users and users were not able to access the application.
                I ran quick test and identified that replication in the SQL
                database had been broken and it lead to the issue. contacted the
                DBA team and asked them to run the resolution steps and issue
                was resolved within 30 minutes. for my quick and spontaneous
                action and saving the more outage time for the application, I
                have been awarded with Star of the Month Award.
